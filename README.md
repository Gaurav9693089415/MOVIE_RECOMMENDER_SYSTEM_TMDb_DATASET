# Movie Recommendation System based on TMDb 5000 Dataset

This project implements a content-based movie recommender system using the **TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset**. Given a selected movie, the system recommends similar movies based on textual features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

Built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, the system includes a web interface where users can select a movie and view its top 5 similar recommendations along with their posters.

* **Recommendation Type:** Content-Based Filtering
* **Dataset:** TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset (from Kaggle)
* **Similarity Metric:** Cosine Similarity (on combined textual features)
* **Frontend:** Streamlit App

---

## Features

‚úîÔ∏è Recommends **Top 5 movies** similar to the selected title
‚úîÔ∏è Displays **movie posters using TMDb API**
‚úîÔ∏è Includes a **clean and interactive web app (Streamlit)**
‚úîÔ∏è Fast load time due to **pre-computed `similarity.pkl` and `movies.pkl` files**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gaurav9693089415/MOVIE_RECOMMENDER_SYSTEM_TMDb.git
cd MOVIE_RECOMMENDER_SYSTEM_TMDb
```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## similarity.pkl (Required File)

Due to GitHub's file size limit (100MB), the `similarity.pkl` file (176MB) is not included in this repository.

Please manually download it from the following link:

üîó [Download similarity.pkl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m9h0mVh0QuCdk7TZxbuVvtJ2_cqdM9c8/view?usp=drive_link)

After downloading, place the `similarity.pkl` file in the root directory of this project (same folder as `app.py`).

---

## Usage

### 1. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

‚úîÔ∏è The app will open in your browser:
**[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**

### 2. Using the App

* Select a movie from the dropdown list.
* Click **"Recommend"**.
* View the **Top 5 recommended movies with posters**.
